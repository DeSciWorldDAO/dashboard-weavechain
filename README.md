TLDR is that we solve the throughput problem, and are flexible with data governance so that data can be managed at enterprise standards if needed. We're really excited by a world in which the data sets used by researchers are more accessible, and can be collaborated on easier. Web3 data will be more secure, have better provenance to show who is using what and how, and also be monetizable if desired to promote fairness between contributors and consumers.","whitePaperLink":"https://www.weavechain.com/learn/hello-world","gallery":[{"name":"Intro","description":"Intro","mediaUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5nCkioLpI8","source":"youtube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5nCkioLpI8"},{"name":"Intro","description":"Intro","mediaUrl":"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZ1fmUf3AigFXZhXKNNhicycC9DPU4vFYEf9rfBz3y8yA","source":"image","link":"https://www.weavechain.com/learn/intro-to-web3"},{"source":"image","mediaUrl":"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSKi1mRT2DkGEM7uG7scauu27Ybwk5RJoweJCsGE6Gwza","link":"https://www.weavechain.com/learn"}],"deleted":false,"primaryColor":"#52e8cd","twitterHandle":"weavechainweb3","logo":"https://i.imgur.com/fOT6gVd.png","discordLink":"https://discord.gg/VjuPrwe4ub","website":"https://www.weavechain.com/","telegramLink":"https://t.me/Weavechain","tags":["Data Storage","Blockchain protocols"]}```
